# Doubly-Linked-List-Queues-And-Stacks-And-Round-Robin-Algorithm-In-Java
## Project Summary:
I programmed stacks and queues using the doubly linked lists as the underlying data structure. The _DLLQueue file contains the implementation of a queue built 
upon a doubly linked list which includes methods such as getting the number of elements in a queue, adding data to a queue, and removing the top element from a queue.
The _DLLQueueTest file tests these methods. Similarly, the _DLLStack file contains the implementation of a stack built upon a doubly linked list which includes methods
such as getting the number of elements in a stack, adding data to a stack, and removing the top element from a queue. The _DLLStackTest file tests these methods.
The _DoublyLinkedList file contains the implementation of the doubly linked list which is used as the underlying data structure for the stacks and queues.
It contains methods such as removing nodes, adding an element to the end of the list, and determining if the list is empty. The _DoublyLinkedListTest file tests these
methods. I also programmed the classic round robin algorithm which is implemented in the _RoundRobin file. The _Task file contains a class that implements a task object
for the round robin algorithm.

Knowledge of doubly linked lists, stacks, queues, and generics were essential for completing this project. 

Testing was done using J-Unit testing.
